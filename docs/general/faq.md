## No matter what, I get `SyntaxError: Block-scoped declarations (let, const, function, class) not yet supported outside strict mode`â€½
Update to Node.js 6.0.0 or newer.

## How do I get voice working?
- Install FFMPEG.
- Install either the `node-opus` package or the `opusscript` package.
  node-opus is greatly preferred, due to it having significantly better performance.

## How do I install FFMPEG?
- **npm:** `npm install ffmpeg-binaries`
- **Ubuntu 16.04:** `sudo apt install ffmpeg`
- **Ubuntu 14.04:** `sudo apt-get install libav-tools`
- **Windows:** `npm install ffmpeg-binaries` or see the [FFMPEG section of AoDude's guide](https://github.com/bdistin/OhGodMusicBot/blob/master/README.md#download-ffmpeg).

## How do I set up node-opus?
- **Ubuntu:** Simply run `npm install node-opus`, and it's done. Congrats!
- **Windows:** Run `npm install --global --production windows-build-tools` in an admin command prompt or PowerShell.
  Then, running `npm install node-opus` in your bot's directory should successfully build it. Woo!
